# ViewPagerCards
ViewPager cards inspired by Duolingo

## Using with gradle
- Add the JitPack repository to your root build.gradle:
```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```

- Add the dependency to your sub build.gradle:
```gradle
dependencies {
   compile 'com.github.mirshahbazi:ViewPagerCards:-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

This is just a sample project.

There's support included for Fragments and normal Views. Check the CardPagerAdapter and CardFragmentPagerAdapter classes.
